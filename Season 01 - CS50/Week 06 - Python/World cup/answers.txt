Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: When the number of simulation is equal to 10 the winner of the world cup can vary a lot so and is often wrong

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 10000 simulations
